Review this conversation for any jj (Jujutsu VCS) commands you ran that:
- Failed with errors
- Produced unexpected or unhelpful output
- Used incorrect syntax or flags
- Could have been done more efficiently

For each mistake or suboptimal usage:
1. Explain what went wrong and why
2. Show the correct approach

Then update the jj skill file at `~/.claude/skills/jj/SKILL.md` with clarifications that would prevent these mistakes in future. Add to existing sections where appropriate, or create new subsections if needed.

If you didn't make any jj mistakes in this conversation, say so.

#+TITLE: Emacs config notes

* Current problems
** DONE on closing the last good buffer in a perspective, purpose dedication fucks us around.
and somehow a buffer from another persp sneaks in i still don't know why.
for instance, in a perspective with a terminal, purpose dedicated, and an edit window, ditto, killing the last persp buffer will switch to another edit buffer from another perspective in the edit-dedicated window, split it for the fallback buffer, and keep the terminal. it should probably de-dedicate the edit window (the current one) and show the fallback.
*** plan
- advise =purpose--dummy-buffer-purpose= to allow for trailing stuff on buffer name, so i can have one per project
- then de-advise =doom--switch-to-fallback-buffer-maybe-a=; re-advise =kill-current-buffer= in the same vein to create a purpose dummy buffer particular to the current project
*** what actually happened
got rid of purpose haha
** DONE no modeline in terms, should disable =hide-mode-line-mode= on hook
** TODO opening a window to the left of one with a "my/preserved" size, it kills off the size preservation
- is this to do with the window not being a "side" window or something? yes.
** TODO lispy(ville) key themes not quite all coming through?
** DONE set SSH_AUTH_SOCK properly for magit
** DONE some buffers (mainly help) aren't added to the perspective
add all buffers to the active perspective? apart from messages/scratch?
** TODO exact snippet matches order lower than inexact code completions
** DONE vterm should disable word wrap mode
** DONE fix esc in vterm somehow
** DONE main persp gets all buffers on startup for some reason
** TODO flycheck and next-error not working well together.
* Features
** DONE key bindings / hooks for sticky-width terminal
** DONE multiple terminals
- owned by persp
- renameable
- fuzzy switching
- mru
** TODO switch to open buffer in any workspace
** TODO opening buffers prefers windows that have previously had buffers of the same purpose
- how does this previous purpose stick around, and how can you clear it?
** DONE kill other workspace edit buffers
** DONE "subprojects"
useful parts of a monorepo - apps, libraries, etc.
** TODO search in subproject
** DONE magit branch select order is not useful - ideally MRU
** TODO conditionally switch from doom's workspaces to emacs 28's tab bar
** TODO binary search movement hydra
** TODO tree sitter movement
** TODO nodejs in an emacs loadable module. everyone would hate me.
